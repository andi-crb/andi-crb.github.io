          <h2>Empathy</h2>
            <h3>Try the 'Just Like Me' and 'Loving Kindness' practices. How did you feel?</h3>
              <p>
                I struggled a bit with the repetition of these, but they had an impact. The book said most people feel happy after them but the impact was the opposite for me - I started thinking about some issues affecting people I care about and getting quite sad. I may just have been in a difficult place when I tried them, I'm not sure.
              </p>
            <h3>Try the 'Traditional Practice of Loving Kindness' - Did you prefer this technique?</h3>
              <p>
                I think this made more sense to me because there was more focus on the specific issue at hand and it was less scripted, although again I found the repetition a little uncomfortable.
              </p>
            <h3>Have you been in a situation in which Empathetic Listening could have improved a conversation? Or, describe a situation where empathetic listening practices worked well?</h3>
              <p>
                I currently work with students and sometimes use some level of empathetic listening when someone is upset about a situation. Often, while I can't always give them what they want, it reveals something I might not have thought of, such as a cultural imperative or family pressure, which I may be able to give them alternatives to address. I do think it's important to not overdo it, however, as it can become patronising, intrusive, or sound like you're repeating a script.
              </p>
            <h3>Give an example of "person praise" and "process praise"
              <p>
                Person praise: "you're really intelligent". Process praise: "You've put a lot of effort into your studies this year and overcome some tough roadblocks, and I'm glad it's paid off for you."
