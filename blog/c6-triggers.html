          <h2>Reflections on Chapter 5 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em></h2>
          <p>
            I had a go at some of the trigger training exercises. To be honest, they were quite an uncomfortable experience - I tend to have that response to a lot of exercises regarding your experience of your body (and I understand why). I definitely noticed some experiences of tension and frustration.

            The chapter discusses befriending emotions. If I were to pick one it would be anger. I think used appropriately anger can be creative and productive, but often I find myself misdirecting it - and while I have the self-control not to express it, that only makes me feel bad about myself.
