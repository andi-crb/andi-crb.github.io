    <h2>Time and Habits</h2>
<p>I've had a read through the time and habit management resources. I'm someone who needs to use a lot of techniques to manage my time, so most of these ideas weren't new to me. One thing I did realise is that I'm very reliant on routine, and with leaving my job and beginning bootcamp, and then a whole bunch of unknowns to follow, I'm going to have to have strategies in place to stay on track.</p>
<p>I've used the Pomodoro technique very successfully in the past, but although I continue to make use of some of the principles, I've fallen out of the habit. I've just downloaded an unofficial Pomodoro timer and am planning to give that another go. I'm also going to look at ways of make use of timeboxing more generally.</p>
<p>The information on habit formation was interesting, and something I'd like to look at ways to do better. I currently use <a href="http://habitica.com">Habitica</a> which basically turns your to-do list into a role playing game, but also helps you manage daily habits (eg "take vitamins") and habits you want to do more of but not necessarily on a particular schedule (eg "make lunch the previous evening", "go swimming").</p>
