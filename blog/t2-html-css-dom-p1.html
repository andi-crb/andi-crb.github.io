    <h2>Reflections on HTML, CSS, and the DOM</h2>
      <h3>Wishlist</h3>
        <p>Some features I'm interested in implementing on my website include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Menu bar with drop-downs</li>
          <li>Responsive design (there are currently issues with the width of some of my elements when viewed on a mobile device)</li>
          <li>The ability to scroll through text in some elements while leaving others static</li>
          <li>More specific (though still clean and readable) fonts</li>
          <li>While they may not be appropriate for the page, or achievable with my current skills, I'm really interested in images that integrate with other elements (such as the tree at <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/132/">this CSS Zen Garden site</a>) or using css to emulate non-website media, such as at <a href="http://papersnever.nz/">Papers Never</a></li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
        <p>I'd think of them like a planned and regulated town. The HTML is the content of the town, eg "a row of 10 houses there, a primary school here, a main road over there". The CSS is the nature and appearance of these - eg "all houses are two storey, the parks are planted with native grasses, all stop signs are red". The DOM (Document Object Model) is like the town plans. JavaScript can be used to manipulate html content - these can be seen as town edicts directed at all of a particular type of content. For example, "convert all high schools into emergency shelters" or "rename every street after a budgie owned by the recently deceased president".</p> 
      <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
        <p>Boxifying design means concieving of each element of a design (such as a title, or an image) as a box, irrespective of whether it appears to take a box shape. This can involve mentally (or physically) drawing a box around each element.</p>
      <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
        <p>The box model is, as described above, a model which sees each element as a box. That box incorporated the content itself, the element (such as an image), padding around the image, then (working outwards) a border and then finally a margin.</p>
