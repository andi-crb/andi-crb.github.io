              <h2><a href="http://andi-crb.github.io/blog/t7-javascript-basics.html">Javascript Basics</a></h2>
          <p>
            If HTML is primarily concerned with the content of a webpage, and css with the design or appearance, then Javascript relates to the functionality. Javascript is used for actions within a page - it might control animation, or take input from the user and deliver an outcome based on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Control Flow affects which parts of the code happen and in which order. A simple sequence of actions might be that I wake up, check the clock, get up, have a shower, and so on. But hang on. What if I look at the clock and it's only 2am. I don't normally get up and shower at that time. So I might need an "if" in my routine. I still wake up and check the clock, but and IF it is after 6am then I get up, have a shower. If not - or what we might term else - I go back to sleep. Obviously in the reality this is much more complicated - I wouldn't go back to sleep if the power was out and there were sirens sounding everywhere, and I wouldn't if it were 5:59 because there'd be no point - so some of these statements can get quite complicated.
          </p>
          <p>
            A loop can be used for a similar purpose. I might set up a loop to keep doing the same thing as long as a condition is met. So, for example, WHILE it is earlier than 6am, keep trying to go back to sleep. The script will keep repeating and telling me to keep trying to go back to sleep, until it is 6am.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both arrays and object literals contain groups of items. Consider the following group: 7, duck, grandma, purple. All of these could be in a array called Timmy - so we know these relate to Timmy somehow, and we might be able to guess what some of them are. If I want to see all the things associated with Timmy, I can do that. If I want to access an individual one, I can only say what it is by the order it's in - the second item, for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if this is an object, each item can have a property name or label. So I can define 7 as Timmy's age, duck as his favourite animal, and so on, and then I can tell the programme to tell me Timmy's favourite animal. I might have a lot of these for different children, so I might write some code that when the input their name it writes a story including their favourite animal and favourite colour.
          </p>
          <p>
              A function is a block of code that performs a task. You can give the function a name, and tell it to run at whatever point in your code. Functions take an input and return an output. As a very simple example, a function might take your name (the input) and return Hello and your name (the output). So you input "Aoife" and the function outputs "Hello Aoife". Use of functions saves space and time in not typing it out every time, and makes your code clearer. Even more importantly, functions can run on different inputs.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't have a good explanation for the differences between functional and object oriented programming just yet, sorry! I've read some stack overflow answers (<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-object-oriented-programming">this one in particular</a>), but have not yet got my head around it sufficiently to form my own explanation. I'll try and come back to this.

          <h2><a href="c7-motivation.html">Reflections on Chapter 6 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em></a></h2>
          <p>
            This chapter describes three types of happiness. Pleasure is seen as a short term, intense, exhilarating high. Passion is when you care about and are interested in something - a project you can become absorbed in, for example - and the third, Higher Purpose, refers to something that has a much deeper level of meaning to you and is sustainable over a longer period of time. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I think my core values would be integrity, loyalty and the belief that I have a responsibility to stand with others, especially when they are marginalised, and to use the resources I have access to to support others.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think a lot of the ideas about resilience and how it can be categorised made a lot of sense to me. I do think, however, that a lot of resilience comes from the communities we are part of, which perhaps wasn't acknowledged as much as I'd have liked in the chapter.

          <h2><a href="c6-triggers.html">Reflections on Chapter 5 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em></a></h2>
          <p>
            I had a go at some of the trigger training exercises. To be honest, they were quite an uncomfortable experience - I tend to have that response to a lot of exercises regarding your experience of your body (and I understand why). I definitely noticed some experiences of tension and frustration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The chapter discusses befriending emotions. If I were to pick one it would be anger. I think used appropriately anger can be creative and productive, but often I find myself misdirecting it - and while I have the self-control not to express it, that only makes me feel bad about myself.

          <p>
            A responsive site is one that adapts based on the device it is being used on, to ensure high levels of usability across a range of devices. Most typically, this relates to screen size and the size and placing of elements of the site, but a site can also be responsive to factors such as not showing high bandwidth elements on a mobile device (where connections are likely to be slower and data more expensive) and likely method of input (eg touch screen versus mouse and keyboard).
          </p>
          <p>
            Mobile first design means designing a site firstly for a mobile device, then adding additional elements for a desktop version, rather than creating a desktop version and then paring it back for a mobile version. There are certainly downsides to doing this, but it is important to at least consider given the increasing popularity of mobile devices. It has the advantage of forcing the developer to be clear about what is truly an essential part of the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frameworks are packages of code that create a basic, well, framework for your website. They can be as basic as a grid system or provide a much more detailed level of structure, such as typography, navigation and so on. Advantages include not having to reinvent the wheel or duplicate code, that it is easier to have everyone on the same page when working collaboratively, and that they can provide a straight-forward solution to many common CSS issues. However they can be restrictive, have unnecessary code for your project (which increases site loading times) and if you are using multiple frameworks each can take some time to learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            A wireframe is a sketch of the layout of a web page, the focus being on the location of elements such as the menu, images, text etc, rather than content or the details of design such as typography. This is important as a reference guide, for collaborative working, and potentially for consultation with clients.
          </p>
          <p>These are some wireframes I drew for this site:</p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="/../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="wireframe of the index page for desktop display" width="45%" />
            <img src="/../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="wireframe of the blog page for desktop display" width="45%" />
            <img src="/../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="wireframe of the index page for mobile display" width="45%" />
            <img src="/../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" alt="wireframe of the blog page for mobile display" width="45%" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The aspect I found most difficult to implement was the navigation bar - it took a lot of experimentation and looking at examples to get there, and I found that within the Skeleton framework, css didn't always behave how I'd expect.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main accessibility features I included were to ensure alt text for images, and a good level of contrast between text and background. THe usability features included responsive design (this included the navigation changing from horizantal to stacked, the header text changing size and the stacking of the aside and article elements on smaller screens) the fixed position of the navigation on larger screens (but I did not include that for mobile due to the high percentage of the screen it would take up, a clear consistent colour scheme, and the site arranged in the basic way a user would be familiar with (as well as the accessibility features mentioned previously).
