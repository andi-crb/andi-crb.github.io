            <h3>Which concepts did you find most difficult?</h3>
              <p>I feel that every time I learn something it opens up a number more areas to learn, and that I have found various topics more difficult along the way but then got to grips with them. Over the course of Phase 0, I've particularly struggled with writing javascript from scratch and with understanding github, but now feel I have a much better handle on them - while I have plenty to learn, they are no longer active problem areas.</p>
            <h3>Which skills/concepts do you feel still confused by? (Don't worry, we don't expect you to have mastered everything!)</h3>
              <p>I struggle a bit with recursion, and also with understanding scope in javascript. I've made progress on both, but am not there yet. I have been using very little jQuery and feel I have a long way to go in picking it up.</p>
            <h3>Which skills/concepts do you feel you understand best?</h3>
              <p>I came to the course having used HTML a lot, but with quite out of date knowledge, and some CSS experience - I feel much more comfortable with both of those and that I have a thorough understanding. While I don't have strong design skills in the "wow that looks amazing" sense, I do feel I hacve a solid grasp of usability and accessibility, and can create a solid website design that takes both into account. On the javascript side, I'm really pleased that I now feel comfortable with iteration, as that was a bit of a struggle...</p>
            <h3>Which aspects of web development so far do you enjoy the most?</h3>
              <p>I really enjoy thinking about user experience, and creating a website accordingly. I love the problem solving aspects of javascript, thinking creatively about how to approach a problem, and the satisfaction of building something - however small or simple - from scratch that is functional and useful.</p>

          <h2><a href="c8-empathy.html">Empathy</a></h2>
            <h3>Try the 'Just Like Me' and 'Loving Kindness' practices. How did you feel?</h3>
              <p>
                I struggled a bit with the repetition of these, but they had an impact. The book said most people feel happy after them but the impact was the opposite for me - I started thinking about some issues affecting people I care about and getting quite sad. I may just have been in a difficult place when I tried them, I'm not sure.
              </p>
            <h3>Try the 'Traditional Practice of Loving Kindness' - Did you prefer this technique?</h3>
              <p>
                I think this made more sense to me because there was more focus on the specific issue at hand and it was less scripted, although again I found the repetition a little uncomfortable.
              </p>
            <h3>Have you been in a situation in which Empathetic Listening could have improved a conversation? Or, describe a situation where empathetic listening practices worked well?</h3>
              <p>
                I currently work with students and sometimes use some level of empathetic listening when someone is upset about a situation. Often, while I can't always give them what they want, it reveals something I might not have thought of, such as a cultural imperative or family pressure, which I may be able to give them alternatives to address. I do think it's important to not overdo it, however, as it can become patronising, intrusive, or sound like you're repeating a script.
              </p>
            <h3>Give an example of "person praise" and "process praise"</h3>
              <p>
                Person praise: "you're really intelligent". Process praise: "You've put a lot of effort into your studies this year and overcome some tough roadblocks, and I'm glad it's paid off for you."

                <h2><a href="t5-problem-solving.html">Problem Solving</a></h2>
<p>
I can't think of any specific examples, but there have been a number of times when I've got completely stuck and the answer was very obvious - I was using = instead of == or === for example, or had missed out something. Sometimes when I look at code too much I stop seeing it, so I've learned to take a break when I can and come back to it, and if not ask for help. I think with practice I'm getting better at knowing where I'm likely to make these obvious mistakes.</p>
<p> While I would hesitate to describe any of my code as elegant just yet, I'm quite proud of the solution I came up with to the freeCodeCamp Roman Numerals problem. I found it initially intimidating, as I realised it was more complex than my initial ideas, but I kept a clear head, broke it down into several parts and looked up some ideas on the MDN to see if they were likely to work. After a difficult week, being able to do this was a boost to my confidence.
</p>
<p>
  On specific problem solving techniques:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Psuedocode: I'm quite comfortable using this, though I tend to do so more mentally than to write it out.</li>
<li>Trying something: This was difficult for me, as I'd prefer to have something neat before I start, but I know that's not feasible so I've learned to push past that and just try and get a small step in the code working, or to solve a simpler version of the problem, intially, and go from there.</li>
<li>Rubber ducky method: I had to look this up, and haven't specifically tried it, but I found sometimes when I was asking my partner (who is, to be clear, not a duck of any substance) I would often realise the solution while explaining to her what I was trying to do, so this definitely sounds worth a try.</li>
<li>Reading error messagesI'm really bad at this but learning! My instinct is just to go "I don't know what that means!" and overlook it rather than think it through or google it.</li>
<li>Console.logging: I don't use this much, and should probably try doing so more, though I often do return variables in turn to troubleshoot, which can be similar in some respects.</li>
<li>Googling: I do this a lot. Initially it was of limited help because I'd either not understand what came up or be tempted to copy code without understanding it, but as my knowledge (and particularly ability to interpret) has increased, I've found this, and particularly Stack Overflow discussions, invaluable.</li>
<li>Asking your peers for help: I don't do this very often, which may be just because I'm not in the habit of it, or because not being in the same place/available at the same time makes this harder (I know this can be worked around with screen shares and so on but that's an extra step). I'm sure this will change a lot when bootcamp starts.</li>
<li>Asking coaches for help: same as above</li>
<li>Improving your process with reflection: I definitely do this, though a lot of it is quite informal - thinking back to what worked on previous occassions, knowing what I find difficult so I can work on it, and so on.</li>
</ul>
Specific functions:
<ul>
<li>The .map() function does the same thing to everything in a group of object. So if I had a group of numbers, I might want to add five to each of them. Or if I had a group of words I could add an "s" to the end of them to make them plural (obviously wouldn't work with all words, however) or I could make them all uppercase.</li>
<li>The .filter() function takes a group of items (an array) and creates a new group with only those that meet particular criteria. For example, I might have an array containing all the whole numbers from one to ten. I can use the filter function to create a new group that only contains those of the numbers that are under 5, or are divisible by 2, and so on.</li>
<li>The .reduce() function reduces a group of things to a single thing, but it does so by collapsing them one at the time. You will tell it to do something (such as add together) the first two items, and it will do that, and then it will add together the new first two (the value created and the next one), until there is just one left.</li>
</ul>

 <p>I confess to not fully understanding the difference between recursion and iteration, but essentially, while they both involve repetition, iteration goes through the same block of code and then loops round and repeats it, where as recursion repeatedly calls itself. In practical terms, iteration is more complex/harder to write but involves less memory usage, while recursion is the reverse.</p></article>

              <h2><a href="http://andi-crb.github.io/blog/t7-javascript-basics.html">Javascript Basics</a></h2>
          <p>
            If HTML is primarily concerned with the content of a webpage, and css with the design or appearance, then Javascript relates to the functionality. Javascript is used for actions within a page - it might control animation, or take input from the user and deliver an outcome based on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Control Flow affects which parts of the code happen and in which order. A simple sequence of actions might be that I wake up, check the clock, get up, have a shower, and so on. But hang on. What if I look at the clock and it's only 2am. I don't normally get up and shower at that time. So I might need an "if" in my routine. I still wake up and check the clock, but and IF it is after 6am then I get up, have a shower. If not - or what we might term else - I go back to sleep. Obviously in the reality this is much more complicated - I wouldn't go back to sleep if the power was out and there were sirens sounding everywhere, and I wouldn't if it were 5:59 because there'd be no point - so some of these statements can get quite complicated.
          </p>
          <p>
            A loop can be used for a similar purpose. I might set up a loop to keep doing the same thing as long as a condition is met. So, for example, WHILE it is earlier than 6am, keep trying to go back to sleep. The script will keep repeating and telling me to keep trying to go back to sleep, until it is 6am.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both arrays and object literals contain groups of items. Consider the following group: 7, duck, grandma, purple. All of these could be in a array called Timmy - so we know these relate to Timmy somehow, and we might be able to guess what some of them are. If I want to see all the things associated with Timmy, I can do that. If I want to access an individual one, I can only say what it is by the order it's in - the second item, for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if this is an object, each item can have a property name or label. So I can define 7 as Timmy's age, duck as his favourite animal, and so on, and then I can tell the programme to tell me Timmy's favourite animal. I might have a lot of these for different children, so I might write some code that when the input their name it writes a story including their favourite animal and favourite colour.
          </p>
          <p>
              A function is a block of code that performs a task. You can give the function a name, and tell it to run at whatever point in your code. Functions take an input and return an output. As a very simple example, a function might take your name (the input) and return Hello and your name (the output). So you input "Aoife" and the function outputs "Hello Aoife". Use of functions saves space and time in not typing it out every time, and makes your code clearer. Even more importantly, functions can run on different inputs.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't have a good explanation for the differences between functional and object oriented programming just yet, sorry! I've read some stack overflow answers (<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-object-oriented-programming">this one in particular</a>), but have not yet got my head around it sufficiently to form my own explanation. I'll try and come back to this.

          <p>
            This chapter describes three types of happiness. Pleasure is seen as a short term, intense, exhilarating high. Passion is when you care about and are interested in something - a project you can become absorbed in, for example - and the third, Higher Purpose, refers to something that has a much deeper level of meaning to you and is sustainable over a longer period of time. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I think my core values would be integrity, loyalty and the belief that I have a responsibility to stand with others, especially when they are marginalised, and to use the resources I have access to to support others.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think a lot of the ideas about resilience and how it can be categorised made a lot of sense to me. I do think, however, that a lot of resilience comes from the communities we are part of, which perhaps wasn't acknowledged as much as I'd have liked in the chapter.

          <h2><a href="c6-triggers.html">Reflections on Chapter 5 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em></a></h2>
          <p>
            I had a go at some of the trigger training exercises. To be honest, they were quite an uncomfortable experience - I tend to have that response to a lot of exercises regarding your experience of your body (and I understand why). I definitely noticed some experiences of tension and frustration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The chapter discusses befriending emotions. If I were to pick one it would be anger. I think used appropriately anger can be creative and productive, but often I find myself misdirecting it - and while I have the self-control not to express it, that only makes me feel bad about myself.

          <p>
            A responsive site is one that adapts based on the device it is being used on, to ensure high levels of usability across a range of devices. Most typically, this relates to screen size and the size and placing of elements of the site, but a site can also be responsive to factors such as not showing high bandwidth elements on a mobile device (where connections are likely to be slower and data more expensive) and likely method of input (eg touch screen versus mouse and keyboard).
          </p>
          <p>
            Mobile first design means designing a site firstly for a mobile device, then adding additional elements for a desktop version, rather than creating a desktop version and then paring it back for a mobile version. There are certainly downsides to doing this, but it is important to at least consider given the increasing popularity of mobile devices. It has the advantage of forcing the developer to be clear about what is truly an essential part of the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frameworks are packages of code that create a basic, well, framework for your website. They can be as basic as a grid system or provide a much more detailed level of structure, such as typography, navigation and so on. Advantages include not having to reinvent the wheel or duplicate code, that it is easier to have everyone on the same page when working collaboratively, and that they can provide a straight-forward solution to many common CSS issues. However they can be restrictive, have unnecessary code for your project (which increases site loading times) and if you are using multiple frameworks each can take some time to learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            A wireframe is a sketch of the layout of a web page, the focus being on the location of elements such as the menu, images, text etc, rather than content or the details of design such as typography. This is important as a reference guide, for collaborative working, and potentially for consultation with clients.
          </p>
          <p>These are some wireframes I drew for this site:</p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="/../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="wireframe of the index page for desktop display" width="45%" />
            <img src="/../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="wireframe of the blog page for desktop display" width="45%" />
            <img src="/../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="wireframe of the index page for mobile display" width="45%" />
            <img src="/../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" alt="wireframe of the blog page for mobile display" width="45%" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The aspect I found most difficult to implement was the navigation bar - it took a lot of experimentation and looking at examples to get there, and I found that within the Skeleton framework, css didn't always behave how I'd expect.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main accessibility features I included were to ensure alt text for images, and a good level of contrast between text and background. THe usability features included responsive design (this included the navigation changing from horizantal to stacked, the header text changing size and the stacking of the aside and article elements on smaller screens) the fixed position of the navigation on larger screens (but I did not include that for mobile due to the high percentage of the screen it would take up, a clear consistent colour scheme, and the site arranged in the basic way a user would be familiar with (as well as the accessibility features mentioned previously).
