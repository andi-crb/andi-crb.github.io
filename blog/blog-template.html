          <h2><a href="c6-triggers.html">Reflections on Chapter 5 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em></a></h2>
          <p>
            I had a go at some of the trigger training exercises. To be honest, they were quite an uncomfortable experience - I tend to have that response to a lot of exercises regarding your experience of your body (and I understand why). I definitely noticed some experiences of tension and frustration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The chapter discusses befriending emotions. If I were to pick one it would be anger. I think used appropriately anger can be creative and productive, but often I find myself misdirecting it - and while I have the self-control not to express it, that only makes me feel bad about myself.

          <p>
            A responsive site is one that adapts based on the device it is being used on, to ensure high levels of usability across a range of devices. Most typically, this relates to screen size and the size and placing of elements of the site, but a site can also be responsive to factors such as not showing high bandwidth elements on a mobile device (where connections are likely to be slower and data more expensive) and likely method of input (eg touch screen versus mouse and keyboard).
          </p>
          <p>
            Mobile first design means designing a site firstly for a mobile device, then adding additional elements for a desktop version, rather than creating a desktop version and then paring it back for a mobile version. There are certainly downsides to doing this, but it is important to at least consider given the increasing popularity of mobile devices. It has the advantage of forcing the developer to be clear about what is truly an essential part of the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frameworks are packages of code that create a basic, well, framework for your website. They can be as basic as a grid system or provide a much more detailed level of structure, such as typography, navigation and so on. Advantages include not having to reinvent the wheel or duplicate code, that it is easier to have everyone on the same page when working collaboratively, and that they can provide a straight-forward solution to many common CSS issues. However they can be restrictive, have unnecessary code for your project (which increases site loading times) and if you are using multiple frameworks each can take some time to learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            A wireframe is a sketch of the layout of a web page, the focus being on the location of elements such as the menu, images, text etc, rather than content or the details of design such as typography. This is important as a reference guide, for collaborative working, and potentially for consultation with clients.
          </p>
          <p>These are some wireframes I drew for this site:</p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="/../images/wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="wireframe of the index page for desktop display" width="45%" />
            <img src="/../images/wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="wireframe of the blog page for desktop display" width="45%" />
            <img src="/../images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="wireframe of the index page for mobile display" width="45%" />
            <img src="/../images/wireframe-blog-page-mobile.jpg" alt="wireframe of the blog page for mobile display" width="45%" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The aspect I found most difficult to implement was the navigation bar - it took a lot of experimentation and looking at examples to get there, and I found that within the Skeleton framework, css didn't always behave how I'd expect.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main accessibility features I included were to ensure alt text for images, and a good level of contrast between text and background. THe usability features included responsive design (this included the navigation changing from horizantal to stacked, the header text changing size and the stacking of the aside and article elements on smaller screens) the fixed position of the navigation on larger screens (but I did not include that for mobile due to the high percentage of the screen it would take up, a clear consistent colour scheme, and the site arranged in the basic way a user would be familiar with (as well as the accessibility features mentioned previously).
