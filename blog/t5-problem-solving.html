          <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
<p>
I can't think of any specific examples, but there have been a number of times when I've got completely stuck and the answer was very obvious - I was using = instead of == or === for example, or had missed out something. Sometimes when I look at code too much I stop seeing it, so I've learned to take a break when I can and come back to it, and if not ask for help. I think with practice I'm getting better at knowing where I'm likely to make these obvious mistakes.</p>
<p> While I would hesitate to describe any of my code as elegant just yet, I'm quite proud of the solution I came up with to the freeCodeCamp Roman Numerals problem. I found it initially intimidating, as I realised it was more complex than my initial ideas, but I kept a clear head, broke it down into several parts and looked up some ideas on the MDN to see if they were likely to work. After a difficult week, being able to do this was a boost to my confidence.
</p>
<p>
  On specific problem solving techniques:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Psuedocode: I'm quite comfortable using this, though I tend to do so more mentally than to write it out.</li>
<li>Trying something: This was difficult for me, as I'd prefer to have something neat before I start, but I know that's not feasible so I've learned to push past that and just try and get a small step in the code working, or to solve a simpler version of the problem, intially, and go from there.</li>
<li>Rubber ducky method: I had to look this up, and haven't specifically tried it, but I found sometimes when I was asking my partner (who is, to be clear, not a duck of any substance) I would often realise the solution while explaining to her what I was trying to do, so this definitely sounds worth a try.</li>
<li>Reading error messagesI'm really bad at this but learning! My instinct is just to go "I don't know what that means!" and overlook it rather than think it through or google it.</li>
<li>Console.logging: I don't use this much, and should probably try doing so more, though I often do return variables in turn to troubleshoot, which can be similar in some respects.</li>
<li>Googling: I do this a lot. Initially it was of limited help because I'd either not understand what came up or be tempted to copy code without understanding it, but as my knowledge (and particularly ability to interpret) has increased, I've found this, and particularly Stack Overflow discussions, invaluable.</li>
<li>Asking your peers for help: I don't do this very often, which may be just because I'm not in the habit of it, or because not being in the same place/available at the same time makes this harder (I know this can be worked around with screen shares and so on but that's an extra step). I'm sure this will change a lot when bootcamp starts.</li>
<li>Asking coaches for help: same as above</li>
<li>Improving your process with reflection: I definitely do this, though a lot of it is quite informal - thinking back to what worked on previous occassions, knowing what I find difficult so I can work on it, and so on.</li>
</ul>
Specific functions:
<ul>
<li>The .map() function does the same thing to everything in a group of object. So if I had a group of numbers, I might want to add five to each of them. Or if I had a group of words I could add an "s" to the end of them to make them plural (obviously wouldn't work with all words, however) or I could make them all uppercase.</li>
<li>The .filter() function takes a group of items (an array) and creates a new group with only those that meet particular criteria. For example, I might have an array containing all the whole numbers from one to ten. I can use the filter function to create a new group that only contains those of the numbers that are under 5, or are divisible by 2, and so on.</li>
<li>The .reduce() function reduces a group of things to a single thing, but it does so by collapsing them one at the time. You will tell it to do something (such as add together) the first two items, and it will do that, and then it will add together the new first two (the value created and the next one), until there is just one left.</li>
</ul>

 <p>I confess to not fully understanding the difference between recursion and iteration, but essentially, while they both involve repetition, iteration goes through the same block of code and then loops round and repeats it, where as recursion repeatedly calls itself. In practical terms, iteration is more complex/harder to write but involves less memory usage, while recursion is the reverse.</p>
