          <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <h3>Which concepts did you find most difficult?</h3>
              <p>I feel that every time I learn something it opens up a number more areas to learn, and that I have found various topics more difficult along the way but then got to grips with them. Over the course of Phase 0, I've particularly struggled with writing javascript from scratch and with understanding github, but now feel I have a much better handle on them - while I have plenty to learn, they are no longer active problem areas.</p>
            <h3>Which skills/concepts do you feel still confused by? (Don't worry, we don't expect you to have mastered everything!)</h3>
              <p>I struggle a bit with recursion, and also with understanding scope in javascript. I've made progress on both, but am not there yet. I have been using very little jQuery and feel I have a long way to go in picking it up.</p>
            <h3>Which skills/concepts do you feel you understand best?</h3>
              <p>I came to the course having used HTML a lot, but with quite out of date knowledge, and some CSS experience - I feel much more comfortable with both of those and that I have a thorough understanding. While I don't have strong design skills in the "wow that looks amazing" sense, I do feel I hacve a solid grasp of usability and accessibility, and can create a solid website design that takes both into account. On the javascript side, I'm really pleased that I now feel comfortable with iteration, as that was a bit of a struggle...</p>
            <h3>Which aspects of web development so far do you enjoy the most?</h3>
              <p>I really enjoy thinking about user experience, and creating a website accordingly. I love the problem solving aspects of javascript, thinking creatively about how to approach a problem, and the satisfaction of building something - however small or simple - from scratch that is functional and useful.</p>
