          <h2>Reflections on Chapter 6 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em></h2>
          <p>
            This chapter describes three types of happiness. Pleasure is seen as a short term, intense, exhilarating high. Passion is when you care about and are interested in something - a project you can become absorbed in, for example - and the third, Higher Purpose, refers to something that has a much deeper level of meaning to you and is sustainable over a longer period of time. 
          </p>

            I think my core values would be integrity, loyalty and the belief that I have a responsibility to stand with others, especially when they are marginalised, and to use the resources I have access to to support others.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think a lot of the ideas about resilience and how it can be categorised made a lot of sense to me. I do think, however, that a lot of resilience comes from the communities we are part of, which perhaps wasn't acknowledged as much as I'd have liked in the chapter.
