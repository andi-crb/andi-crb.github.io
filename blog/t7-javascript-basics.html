          <h2>Javascript Basics</em></h2>
          <p>
            If HTML is primarily concerned with the content of a webpage, and css with the design or appearance, then Javascript relates to the functionality. Javascript is used for actions within a page - it might control animation, or take input from the user and deliver an outcome based on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Control Flow affects which parts of the code happen and in which order. A simple sequence of actions might be that I wake up, check the clock, get up, have a shower, and so on. But hang on. What if I look at the clock and it's only 2am. I don't normally get up and shower at that time. So I might need an "if" in my routine. I still wake up and check the clock, but and IF it is after 6am then I get up, have a shower. If not - or what we might term else - I go back to sleep. Obviously in the reality this is much more complicated - I wouldn't go back to sleep if the power was out and there were sirens sounding everywhere, and I wouldn't if it were 5:59 because there'd be no point - so some of these statements can get quite complicated.
          </p>
          <p>
            A loop can be used for a similar purpose. I might set up a loop to keep doing the same thing as long as a condition is met. So, for example, WHILE it is earlier than 6am, keep trying to go back to sleep. The script will keep repeating and telling me to keep trying to go back to sleep, until it is 6am.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both arrays and object literals contain groups of items. Consider the following group: 7, duck, grandma, purple. All of these could be in a array called Timmy - so we know these relate to Timmy somehow, and we might be able to guess what some of them are. If I want to see all the things associated with Timmy, I can do that. If I want to access an individual one, I can only say what it is by the order it's in - the second item, for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if this is an object, each item can have a property name or label. So I can define 7 as Timmy's age, duck as his favourite animal, and so on, and then I can tell the programme to tell me Timmy's favourite animal. I might have a lot of these for different children, so I might write some code that when the input their name it writes a story including their favourite animal and favourite colour.
