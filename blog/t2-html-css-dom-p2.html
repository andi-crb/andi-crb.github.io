      <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
        <p>
          Grid based design is, as it sounds like, basing your design on a grid. That grid has 12 equal columns and a variable number of rows. An element can cover any number of columns, from 1 to all 12. For example, in your first row you may have a logo taking up the first two columns and a heading over the remaining 10.

      <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
        <p>
          Responsive webpages are becoming increasingly important as people use a variety of types of device to access the web, and both large and small screen sizes are becoming increasingly accessible. Responsive webpages allow the style of the page to change based on screen size and other factors, increasing the standard of both visual appearance and usability across a range of devices.

      <h3>Semantic structure?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes please!
        </p>
        <p>
          Semantic structure is a structure based on meaning rather than appearance. It is important for consistency and web accessibility, and is why (for example) we use h1, h2 etc for headings rather than individually just changing the size/colour/font etc/
