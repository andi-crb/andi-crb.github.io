          <h2>Compassion</h2>
            <h3>What are your thoughts about the compassion training?</h3>
              <p>I think developing compassion is important - but I'm sceptical that this is the best way to do it. I think respectfully listening to others' experiences is more important than meditation or repeating phrases.</p>
            <h3>Give a short summary of each of the components of the SCARF model of social behaviour</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Status is your relative importance or seniority. It can be relative to your former self, as well as to others, and that is an easier aspect to increase.</li>
                <li>Certainty is important for a sense of confidence and stability, especially on a macro level.</li>
                <li>Autonomy is a level of control over your own life and environment.</li>
                <li>Relatedness is how we percieve others to be on our side or not - and we often approach strangers with caution.</li>
                <li>Fairness can have a huge impact on people's actions, often rating more highly than other forms of gain - such as financial reward.</li>
            <h3>Difficult conversations and mindful emailing (or slacking!) are highly important at EDA. Is there an example in your life where you applied/didn't apply these concepts? How did you feel about it?</h3>
              <p>I have often needed to handle potentially controversial or sensitive topics by email, both at work and in other contexts, and I have put a lot of thought into my written communication (which I generally find easier than other forms of communication anyway). I have misjudged on occassion, but I feel I handle these well, apologising where necessary and basically just being upfront about what went wrong.</p>
