    <h2>Reflections on Chapter 4 of Search Inside Yourself</h2>
      <h3>Did you connect with any of the analogies for the mind?</h3>
        <p>I liked the idea of being in either "fail" or "recovery" mode, and that confidence can come from understanding the circumstances in which fail mode occurs. As I'm uncomfortable with the idea many people express that you should be confident just because it's a good thing to be, I found the idea of confidence based on genuine awareness and knowledge to be useful.</p>
      <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
        <p>As above, I liked the idea of confidence based on awareness and understanding. While I found it a bit over-simplified, I think the idea that your emotions are not yourself, and therefore can be changed,to be important.</p>
      <h3>How did you find the body scanning?</h3>
        <p>I've learned body scanning before and unfortunately, while I understand some people find it useful, it tends to have quite negative effects for me. However I do find journalling useful so was interested to see that here - I like the <a href="http://750words.com/">750words</a> site for this.
