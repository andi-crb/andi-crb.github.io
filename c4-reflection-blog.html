    <h2>Reflections</h2>
<h3>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</h3>
<p>
What are your impressions?
<h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
<h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
<p>The Fireside Chat video indicates that the instructors are carbon-based bipedal life forms. As a silicon-based life form myself, I was hoping to find some more of my kind to relate to.</p>
<p>More seriously, I don't think there have been vast changes. I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I've learned, and I didn't expect there to be so much attention to topics like usability (as compared to straight-forward coding). The backgrounds of my cohort aren't exactly in line with what I expected - for example, I thought most people would (like myself) be working fulltime through Phase 0. But in broad terms it has aligned with my expectations and I'm not unhappy about the differences.
</p>
<h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
<p>Both! I'm really excited by what it has to offer, what I can create, and the potential for mutual exchange of knowledge, skills, and ideas with the rest of my cohort. I'm also nervous about the intensity of the experience, or that I might fail to grasp a concept and then it will snowball and I'll fall behind. I don't think it's a bad thing to be nervous - hopefully being realistic that the experience may be tough on me will mean I am better prepared.</p>
<p>Reading the reflections of other members of my cohort, it's clear some people see this as either better than or an intrinsically better fit for them than, more conventional tertiary education. I'm in a bit of a different category. While there are certainly problems with conventional education systems, having studied at postgraduate level and worked for a university (in a non-academic role), I've gained a lot from that education and often felt very much at home. While for some people EDA's style will always be a better fit, for me it's very much about where I'm at at this point in time.</p>
